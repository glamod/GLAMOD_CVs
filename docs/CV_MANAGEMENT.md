# Management of Controlled Vocabularies (CVs)

*This is a working document*

## Set up of CV system

We have set up a working CV system for the GLAMOD project. This approach could be applicable to other projects.

The one-off setup is documented here:

 https://github.com/glamod/GLAMOD_CVs/blob/master/docs/INITIAL_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md

## Procedures
 
We propose that the project will:
 - Use the GitHub repositories as the definitive versions of CVs and code.
 - Engage in its own CV management process.
   - GitHub Issues might be a good place to capture discussions about changes to terms.
 - Create fixed releases as GitHub Releases (e.g.: https://github.com/glamod/GLAMOD_CVs/releases/tag/0.0.1)
   -To align with project release schedules.
